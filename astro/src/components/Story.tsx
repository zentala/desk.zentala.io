  },
  {
    phase: 'The Realization',
    title: 'I had no clue how much I actually stood.',
    text: "So I built a sensor — a small laser distance module mounted under the desk. It measures desk height every second. After a week of data, the number hit me: 8% standing time. Out of a 10-hour workday, I stood for less than 50 minutes. And most of that was getting coffee.",
  },
  {
    phase: 'The First Version',
    title: 'I built an app. It showed numbers. Nothing changed.',
    text: "A dashboard with charts, daily stats, weekly averages. Technically impressive. Behaviorally useless. Knowing I sat 92% of the time didn't make me stand up. I needed behavior change, not just data.",
  },
  {
    phase: 'The Breakthrough',
    title: 'I stripped it down and started experimenting.',
    text: "I threw away the dashboard. Instead, I tried different approaches: a thin overlay bar at the top of the screen that slowly turns red. Subtle notifications. A scoring system where sitting too long costs you points. Each experiment taught me something.",
  },
  {
    phase: 'The Experiments',
    title: '300+ hours of testing. 500+ iterations.',
    text: "I tested overlay bars, toast notifications, sound alerts, gamification with negative scores, progressive warnings, break credit systems. Most things didn't work. Some made it worse. But a few combinations clicked — and the results were dramatic.",
  },
  {
    phase: 'The Results',
    title: 'Standing time: 8% → 22%. Back pain: gone.',
    text: "Position changes went from 1.2 per day to 4.8. My lower back pain disappeared after two weeks. The key wasn't showing data — it was the right nudge at the right moment. A subtle color change beats a loud alarm every time.",
